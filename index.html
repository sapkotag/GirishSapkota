                          <br>The program places these words randomly on a word search grid (left to right, diagonally, etc at random locations) and outputs a pdf containing a specified amount of word search puzzles with the solutions at the back. <a href="ExampleWordsearch.pdf">Here</a> is what the full PDF word search book grenerated looks like.
                          <br>I wrote this program in python and used the FPDF python module for all the PDF creation.

After they answered a question, they would be able to see if they selected the correct answer, if they selected the incorrect one they would be shown the correct answer.
                        <br>The program was fairly well-received as it got hundreds of sales and multiple positive reviews.
                        <br>I wrote this program using VB.net and from making this I learned the importance of writing efficient code, improved my VB.net skills as well as my overall programming skills.

                        <br>The rules of Vax-Man were as follows;
                        <br>- Vax-Man can kill a ghost if he comes into contact with it (vaccinates it).
                        <br>- Contact with a ghost does not kill Vax-Man.
                        <br>- Each ghost that has not yet been hit multiplies itself every 30 seconds (the infection grows).
                        <br>- The goal of the game is to collect all the dots before the number of ghosts grows to 32 times the original number.

                          One of the tasks was to show the prices of two historically correlating stocks on a graph. If the correlation ratio of the two stock prices differed by more than -/+10% then it would be shown on the graph and the trader would be alerted.
                          Once alerted, the trader would be able to sell the stock that is expensive and buy the stock that is cheap.
