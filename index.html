             <p>My name is Girish Sapkota. Currently, I am in my first year,
               studying Computer Science at Queen Mary’s University of London.
               The areas of technology I am interested in are; Artificial
               intelligence, Software development, App development. Outside of
               technology, I like swimming, running and doing Muay Thai.</p>

           <section id="Skills">
             <h3>Skills and Achievements</h3>
             <p>These are a few of my Skills and Achievements:</p>
               <ul class="list">
                 <li>Procedural Java Programming - After learning Procedural Java Programming,
                   I created an impossible quiz for my mini project. From this, I
                   learned how to do file input/output, how to get user’s input, how to keep score.
                   As well as the importance of using separate methods to do different tasks.</li>
                 <li>Object Oriented Java Programming - After learning Object Oriented Java
                   Programming, I created a Stocks Simulator. From this I
                   learned why polymorphism is used in programming and why it is good
                   to use many classes to do different things. I also learned how to
                   make Graphic User Interfaces.</li>
                 <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP -  I used the skills I gained from
                   these four to create this portfolio. I used HTML and CSS for the
                   homepage. I used JavaScript for validation in the login and create
                   post forms. And I used PHP for the login and to keep the blog
                   posts in a database.</li>
               </ul>
           </section>

           <section id="Education">
             <h3>Education and Qualifications</h3>
             <ul>
               <li>GCSE's - St. Marks - 2015 to 2017 </li>
               <li>A Levels - Richard Hale - 2017 to 2019</li>
               <li>Bachelor's Degree - Queen Mary University of London - 2019 to Present</li>
             </ul>
           </section>

           <section id="Experience">
             <h3>Experience</h3>
             <p> These are some of my Experience:</p>
               <ul class="list">
                 <li>Barclays Bank - In 2016 I did my work experience at Barclays
                   Bank. I was shadowing the business manager, observing and learning
                   what they were doing as well as helping them out from time to time.
                   I have gained time management skills – why it is crucial to always
                   be on time. As well as how to communicate with clients in a
                   professional manner.</li>
                 <li>Assisting a Computer Science class - In 2018 I assisted my teacher
                    with his year 11 class. I helped students who were struggling with
                    the subject and their coursework. From this, I learned how to
                    communicate with students so I know what it is they are struggling
                    with so I can help them. I also learned how to help students without
                    giving them the answers straight away. Before I thought giving the
                    answer to the students was the best method for them to learn, but
                    after the experience I learned that you need to help them in a way
                    so they reach the answer themselves, and they know how to reach
                    the answer in the future for similar questions.</li>
               </ul>
           </section>

           <section id="Portfolio">
             <h3>Portfolio</h3>
             <p>Here are some of the projects I have done</p>
             <ul class="list">
               <li>Impossible Quiz - This was a program that would ask the user a question
               and give them 3 options. One would be the correct answer, another would be
               the incorrect answer and the other would be an impossible answer. If the user
               picked the correct answer, their score would increase by a random number, if
               they picked the wrong answer their score wouldn't change and if they picked the impossible
               answer they would lose all of their score.</li>
               <li>Stocks Simulator - This programming emulates
               the stock market. The prices change randomly and the fundamental
               reason for the change is shown. The user is able to select from a
               variety of stocks to buy or sell. They are also able to deposit
               and withdraw money from their account. </li>
             </ul>
